# SKILL-GAPS-IN-SMART-WAREHOUSING-A-QUALITATIVE-STUDY-ON-DIGITAL-WAREHOUSING-SYSTEMS
A qualitative and ethnographic study exploring skill gaps in smart warehousing by focusing on human experiences of digital transformation. The research examines generational differences in digital adaptation learning styles and workplace culture within modern warehouse environments.
This repository contains a qualitative research project that explores skill gaps in smart warehousing from a human centered perspective. The study investigates how warehouse employees across different age groups experience and adapt to digital warehousing systems in their everyday work.

As warehouses increasingly adopt technologies such as warehouse management systems handheld scanners automation tools and data driven workflows the nature of warehouse work has fundamentally changed. Tasks that were once based on physical verification and experiential judgement are now mediated through screens system prompts and algorithmic instructions. While these changes promise efficiency and control they also introduce emotional cognitive and learning challenges for the workforce.

This research moves beyond technology first explanations and focuses on lived experiences inside the warehouse. Using ethnographic methods including observation interviews and field notes the study captures how generational differences influence confidence trust learning styles and interaction with digital systems. It highlights how informal peer learning workplace culture and psychological safety play a critical role in bridging digital skill gaps.

The repository is designed to serve students researchers practitioners and policymakers who are interested in smart warehousing digital transformation human centered logistics and Industry five point zero perspectives. It aims to demonstrate that sustainable digital transformation depends not only on advanced systems but also on respect for human experience dignity and knowledge accumulated over time.
